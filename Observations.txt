Let's talk about the observable trends in the data

First of all, the demographics.

Males are overwhelmingly the largest demographic of players who play Heroes of Pymoli making up 84.03% of the playerbase.

Although males are the highest playerbase, women seem to be the ones willing to spend more on the game both by purchasing more expensive items 
The Other / Non-Disclosed players spend the most of the genders, but as there is only a sample size of 15 we can't say for sure.

Another interesting thing is that for a video game it seems the greatest number of players are between the ages of 20-24. 
I would have expected the highest percentage to be in the teens as, stereotypically, they have the most time to play games.

More surprising than that is that there are any number of people who are below the age of 10 playing this game.
Not just that, but somehow people under the age of 10 were able to make purchases 17 times.
I think it isn't unreasable to think that some of these people are not being honest about their age OR are not purchasing these themselves

Lastly, whatever the item "Final Critic" is, it is the most popular item to purchase which also leads it to be the most profitable item.
